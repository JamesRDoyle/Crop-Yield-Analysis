# Crop Yield Analysis

Through the use of Python data science tools such as pandas, this project utilizes crop yield and weather data to identify valuable regions for farmland investment. Although much of what was done in this project could have been completed more easily using other tools (such as data file cleaning in Excel, graphing in R or Tableau, etc.), one of my personal goals for this project was to use as much Python as possible to grow and display my skills.
