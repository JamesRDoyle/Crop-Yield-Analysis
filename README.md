# Crop Yield Analysis

# Background:
Through the use of Python data science tools, this toolset utilizes crop yield and weather data to enable the analysis of crop yield, weather, and drought data. Although much of what was done in this project could have been completed more easily using other tools (such as data file cleaning in Excel, graphing in R or Tableau, etc.), one of my personal goals for this project was to use as much Python as possible to simplify the amount of software knowledge needed to run these tools.
